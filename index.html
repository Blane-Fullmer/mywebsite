    <h2 style="color: white">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="color: white">I (Blane F.) am a student at Iowa State Universiy in Ames Iowa. I study computer engineering, and am in my second year of getting my bachelors degree. This website is quite ugly, but I've been enjoying the process of learning HTML code. The pages are hand written by me, and hosted using github pages. The goal is to hand craft this whole site by myself. I think it's kind of a lost art.</p>
