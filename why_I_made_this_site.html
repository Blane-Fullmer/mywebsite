    <p >This site is coded by me, in an HTML editor called Sublime. There isn't really anything special going on here. Admitedly, it would be easier to create a website like this using some sort of backend like Hugo, and in the future I might switch to something like that. For now though, This is mostly just a way for me to teach myself HTML code and CSS. This is all done from the ground up, no tricks.
